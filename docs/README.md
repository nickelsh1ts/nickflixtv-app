## Motivation

My primary motivation for starting this project was to have a fully automated reproducable streaming serivce with an easy to use application. There is a heavy focus on the user experience for both the server owner and the users. I feel streaming should be **effortless for the user**. Find the media you want, click request or watch already available content, and invite others to join, all in one seamless flow. For the server owner, Streamarr takes all the hassle out of managing a streaming service.

## I need your help!

Streamarr is a large project. I have only just started to scratch the surface, and have a lot more to do. I need your valuable feedback and help to find and fix bugs. Contributions can includes building new features, patching bugs, translating the application, or even just writing documentation.
