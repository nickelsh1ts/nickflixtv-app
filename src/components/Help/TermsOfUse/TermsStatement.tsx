              3.6. The quality of the display of the {messages.AppTitle} content
              may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety
              of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through
              and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD availability is
              subject to your Internet service and device capabilities. Not all
              content is available in all formats, such as HD. Default playback
              settings on cellular networks exclude HD. The minimum connection
              speed for SD quality is 1.0 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster
              connection for improved video quality. A download speed of at
              least 3.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content
              (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher). You are responsible
              for all Internet access charges. Please check with your Internet
              provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges.
              The time it takes to begin watching {messages.AppTitle} content
              will vary based on a number of factors, including your location,
              available bandwidth at the time, the content you have selected and
              the configuration of your {messages.AppTitle} ready device.

              content from {messages.AppTitle} through Plex&trade; ready
              devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and
              functionalities and features may also differ between devices. You
